          <h2>Business Functions in Sprints — But the Winners Focus on Endurance</h2>
    
          <p>
            It’s tempting to think of business as a sprint — short bursts of productivity, adrenaline-fueled launches, and high-stakes hustle. But that’s only half the story. The businesses that thrive over time aren’t sprinting constantly. They’re pacing. Strategically.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Sprints are important. They're how you ship that v1, land that first client, or run that marketing test. But survival? That’s a marathon. It’s consistency. Discipline. Adaptability.
          </p>
    
          <h3>Sprinting Wins Days. Endurance Wins Decades.</h3>
    
          <p>
            Markets reward those who can grind with focus — not just flash brilliance. You don’t need to be first to market; you need to stay in the market long enough to outlearn your competitors. Endurance gives you the space to iterate, reposition, and capitalize when timing finally aligns.
          </p>
    
          <h3>Momentum Compounds</h3>
    
          <p>
            One of the least sexy truths in business: small, repeatable efforts compound. Brands that publish consistently beat the viral one-hit wonders. Systems that are 80% effective but sustainable will outperform perfect systems that burn you out.
          </p>
    
          <h3>What to Optimize For</h3>
    
          <ul>
            <li>✅ Create systems that you won’t hate a month from now.</li>
            <li>✅ Design marketing you can actually maintain.</li>
            <li>✅ Leave margin — for pivots, people, and sanity.</li>
          </ul>
    
          <p>
            In the startup world, there's pressure to run like you’re always on fire. But if you want to win? Breathe. Pace. Run when it matters — but build like you're here for the long haul.
